        <p>
          When you’re looking to hire a coach to improve your performance as a Triathlete, you may not have a clear-cut picture of what you need.  Triathlon Training is here to connect you with the right coaches, but it still takes some research, communication, and self-understanding in order to get what you need.
        </p>
        <p>
          1.    Figure out your own expectations.  If you don’t know what you want to get out of your training, it will be hard to get the right kind of coaching.  Coaches are generally good at getting you the right instruction, but a little self-awareness goes a long way when it  comes to seeking out coaching, especially for first- timers.  Ask yourself things like:   What are my goals for this season?  What race(s) do I plan on training for?  What are my strengths and weaknesses in both fitness and nutrition?  Where have I struggled in particular?  You might think that you have a particular weakness, but teaming up with the right coach can turn that into a strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          2.    Do I want a local coach, or use remote coaching?  Triathlon Training allows you to search coaches in your area, but also gives you the ability to share a calendar with a coach, who can customize your workouts.  It certainly helps to have companions while training, but a coach might not necessarily be the best “training buddy.”  You want their knowledge, experience, and insight into how to improve your performance, but more and more coaching can be done remotely now.  It all comes down to your personal preference.
        </p>
          <p>
            3.  Look for the right combinations of certifications and experience when hiring a coach.  This seems like an obvious point, but there a many different focuses and areas of specialty in the the fitness world.  Maybe you want someone to help you with nutrition.  Maybe you want to focus specifically on swimming.  You don't want to hire a coach living in the plains of Texas to help you tackle the hills and mountains Colorado.  Just remember - you're finding the perfect coach for you!      
          </p>
        <p>
          4. Learn to communicate.  Maybe you have found a few coaches that look like a good fit, so you decide to contact them.  Maybe 3 out of 5 reply so you decide to talk with each of them about training.  Remember the expectations you set for yourself and focus on clearly communicating that to the coach.  Communicate your goals, abilities, areas of focus, strenghts, and weaknesses.  Finally, you may be able to negotiate the price for your their service.  The price of coaching is never set in stone, so you never know what you might get just by asking!
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no perfect path to finding the right coach, but we're here to help you find the best talent out there.  Chances are, the right coach is already looking for you!
