Why train my core? Well, let’s first think of your core muscles as the foundation of a house, and we can say running is that tornado that picked up and threw that house on the witch of the east’s head. In other words our coremuscles are going to be the primary anchors working hard to keep our body stable during your run. This stability is important because it helps your lower body with creating power, maintaining proper running form, and even preventing joint injury. If that’s not enough, its always nice to have a great mid section for that finish line photo.What exercises are best? I like to keep it simple so here are my top 4 core exercises specifically for runners.
</p>

<h3>Plank</h3>
<p>
  We all know it, but so many people do it wrong that I think it’s always worth mentioning. This exercise involves lying on your stomach then pushing up to your elbows and toes. Maintain this position while pulling your navel in toward the spine. The key is to make sure the hips don’t sag and the butt does not rise up, there should be a straight line connecting the head, butt, and heels. Your goal is 60 seconds. Challenge: Try alternating straight leg lifts while holding this form, then move to arm reaches, and finally placing arms or feet on an unstable object.
</p>
<h3>
  Superman
</h3>
<p>
  Yes, this is my favorite super hero, I mean who could resist that cape, but he probably got his great back side from doing a few reps of these. While lying on your stomach lift opposite arm and legs simultaneously while keeping them straight. Again remember to pull the navel into the stomach during the entire exercise. This helps strengthen the low back and transverse abdominus which helps maintain pelvic stability during runs. Also the lifting of the leg helps target the glutes and hamstrings which will give you an extra kick during sprints and hills.Challenge: Lift both arms and legs at the same time, try to hold at the top for 2 seconds each rep.
</p>
<h3>
  Hip Bridge
</h3>
<p>
  If it’s booty you want then it’s booty you get…and some lower back for good measure. In this exercise, lie your back with knees bent at a 45 degree angle and feet flat on the floor. Lift your hips and squeeze your glutes to make a straight line from your knees to shoulders. Hold this position for 2 seconds, then lower slowly coming close to the ground without touching, then repeat for 3 sets of 10 reps. This will help strengthen the glutes, lower back, and shoulders which all help support proper form during running. Challenge: Try adding a kick out at the top of this move or even doing this on one leg for a real butt burner.
</p>
<h3>
  Core Twist
</h3>
<p>
  Though it seems as though runningonly occurs going forward and backward or sagittal plane, much of the running action is actually produced by twisting motions throughout the body. While this twisting is occurring it’s important to maintain propercore stability resisting the pelvic twist in the transverse plane. Sit with knees bent 45 degrees and feet flat on the floor, extend arms and twist then side to side without turning your mid section. You are resisting the turn, not creating it. Do 3 sets of 10, a complete rep is after the arms have turned to each side. Challenge: Try lifting your feet off the floor, then adding weights or a medicine ball to your hands. If you are home a big bag of quinoa or a gallon of water will do.
</p>
<p>
  Running is a great whole body activity that you should take advantage of before the weather gets too cold, but remember that adding in core cross training will make it even better. As little as 15 minutes worth, 3 times a week of core training for runners mixed into your routine can not only make you a better runner, but can keep you on the road and out of rehab!
