There is never enough time to get everything done. Families are perpetually in a state of pandemonium which can feel disruptive and at worst, devastating. I’ve never wanted triathlon to be the ultimate family eater; I’ve never wanted training for triathlon to devastate my family.
</p>
<p>
  The coaches and training systems will warn first-time triathletes, “Talk to your family about this decision.” But this warning says far too little. It should say, “Talk to your family about how much time you will be spending doing other things instead of being with them.” It’s simple math: A full-time job plus a full-time family equals a full-time life. And the triathlon coaches and systems expect us to add another half to full-time triathlon training job to the mix? Something is bound to be compromised.
</p>
<p>
  In my experience what first gets compromised is not our full-time jobs – who wants to get fired? What is first compromised is our full-time family. Race morning is full of absentee dads, moms, brothers and sisters, and friends. At a recent Ironman triathlon I competed in, an age grouper being interviewed on stage the night before the event was asked, “What are you looking forward to after completing your first Ironman?” She replied, “I can’t wait to get into the off season so I can see my family and friends again!” The crowd exploded with laughter as if they totally understood her commitment. I, on the other hand, was sad. Was it worth it?
</p>
<p>
  It doesn’t have to be this way. There is a way to do all of the triathlon training you need while not neglecting your family. The answer will surprise you, because it surprises everybody. Few triathletes have yet to discover how to gain your dream without losing your family along the way. It’s simple: Do it together as a family. I’m serious. Do everything, every part of your training, together. Impossible? Unrealistic? That’s how you once felt before you decided to do a triathlon. And those feelings of impossibility changed when you tried it and discovered that you really could swim, bike, and run all in one continuous push. Well I’m telling you there is a way to train that involves your whole family and still lets you realize your dream of completing or competing in the sport of triathlon. Try it. It’s not impossible and it’s not unrealistic. I’ve seen it work with pros, competitive age-groupers, and even those that just want to finish.
</p>
<p>
  Here’s our philosophy: Family time has greater and more lasting rewards than triathlon training, so I will never train in a way that compromises the relationships I have with my family. If that is a philosophy you share, here are 5 tips that will work for you:Sign everyone in the family up for a race. Even if only one of you is a triathlete, your spouse can run a 5k or 10k or marathon. Not a runner? Fine. Sign up for a 10k walk-a-thon. Are your kids too young to sign-up for something? That’s OK. Make-up a race for them and sign them up. When everyone signs up for something, everyone gets to share a goal – a shared goal unites a family. Do your workouts together. Swim workouts happen at the pool where everyone has something fun to do; bike workouts happen on an indoor trainer where you can watch and interact with your kids while they play; run workouts are always pushing a jogger or letting your kids cycle beside you.
</p>
<p>
  Prioritize High Intensity Training (HIT) over high volume training. Let’s be clear, kids don’t want to be at a pool or in a jogger for absurdly long periods of time. Many high level athletes and coaches are beginning to understand this principle and designing plans that reflect this (check out Ben Greenfield, Graeme Street, or Joe Friel to get you started). 
</p>

<p>
  Organize your family calendar by designing a realistic plan. Workouts don’t “just happen,” they are scheduled. Set realistic training protocols that work with your family’s schedule. Don’t just import a plan you got from a coach or a book without adapting it with your family in mind.Share your story. We have shared our story many times in blogs, in interviews, in Ironman media, and on our website. You will be personally motivated when you “put yourself out there” and share your trials, failures, and successes. You’ll find that people will constantly ask you, “How is the training with the family going?”, each time giving you that extra nudge to keep at it.
