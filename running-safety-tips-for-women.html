Female runners worry about personal safety in a different way than male runners do, and it is important for women to practice safe running habits, wherever we decide to run.  One important decision to make is to refuse to be a victim; then, start practicing safe and smart running habits.  Here are some running safety tips for women to keep in mind during your training.
</p>
<p>1.  Run with your phone, so if you need to make a call, you have it on your body.  I tuck the phone in my shorts (I bought one of the arms things but I hate it, and it advertises I have an expensive piece of technology up for grabs) and go.
</p>
<p>2.  Spend as little time looking down at your phone as possible.  Looking down makes you an attractive grab to a predator, because you are not alert to your surroundings if you are texting or picking music.
</p>
<p>3.  Make eye contact with every single person you pass, even if you or they are wearing sunglasses.  You are less appealing to a predator if you acknowledge them and can remember them.
</p>
<p>4.  Keep your music soft so you can hear what’s going on around you.  This is especially important if you are running on streets or sidewalks—you need to be able to hear a car come up behind you.
</p>
<p>5.  Constantly scan your surroundings, looking side to side, and checking behind you.  Whenever you pass someone, especially men, look behind you to see if the person’s behavior changes.  When I turn a corner, I look behind me to see if someone who wasn’t there before has appeared, or if someone I just passed has disappeared.
</p>
<p>6.  Run with your keys in hand, not tucked in your shorts or tied on your shoe.  Keys make a handy weapon if you need one.
</p>
<p>7.  Watch for the “people” landscape at the park to change.  I’ve noticed that about every 30 minutes, new people start showing up, and the people that were there when I began my run start to leave.
</p>
<p>8.  Play the “If I Were a Predator” game in my head.  Identify women that are distracted and think, “If I were a predator, she would be an easy target.  It’s clear she doesn’t have a clue of what’s going on around her, and she wouldn’t see it coming.”  Or, “That woman is aware of her surroundings and my part in the landscape.  She would not be a good target.”
</p>
<p>9.  Learn from nature.  If you are being chased, think of a gazelle being chased by a cheetah; the gazelle weaves back and forth, changing directions haphazardly and without a pattern to try to tire out the cheetah or throw it off.  Run toward a safe area like a gazelle.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may want to try running with pepper spray or mace, but sprays are often unreliable and can travel with the wind, which may cause them harm to you instead of the perpetrator.  Above all, stay alert and know your surroundings.  While talking about safety can seem tedious and unnecessary, and though this list may seem over-the-top or paranoid, it is always better to be safe rather than sorry.
