  Nutrition is sometimes considered the fourth discipline of triathlon and that is not a notion I can argue with.  Without the proper mix of calories, carbs, proteins and fats training for and racing consistently in the sport of triathlon would be impossible. Our bodies are not meant to function on air and water alone so you can see how vital the proper nutrition is when it comes to triathlon.  The problem, that I see, is that triathletes tend to only focus on their nutrition during their training.  This is a mistake in my opinion because by neglecting your nutrition, even in the off-season, you are starting from a different point than where you left off when the season ended. Am I advocating that you adhere to a strict diet and don't indulge in the occasional candy bar, ice cream and chocolate cake?  Not at all. As a matter of fact I believe that you should answer those indulgences even when you are training because having to strict of a diet could throw off your mental ability to deal with training for 15 to 20 hours per week.  If I had to define myself as a calorie counter or non-calorie counter I would have to say that I count calories as I do meal plan and input my menu into <a href="http://myfitnesspal.com/">My Fitness Pal</a>.  I do this because I want to make sure that during my training I am getting the proper mix of macronutrients which for me is 60%-65% carbohydrates, 10%-15% Protein and the remainder from healthy fats.  When I am in training this combination allows me to train hard, recover and be prepared for race day.

</p>
<p>
Now that I am in my off-season, my first true off-season in three years, I am taking notice of a few different trends that have taken place.  My last race was on May 19th at Ironman Texas and since then I have done my share of swimming, biking and running.  These activities are meant to keep me in good shape and allow me to have a base that is better than where I was prior to entering into my training cycle for IMTX.  When it comes to food though I have not been as stringent in terms of macro-nutrient tracking or even menu planning.  That is not to say that I am not paying attention to what I eat because I am.  I am focusing on getting quality calories into my system but if I feel like having a cookie I will have a cookie.  This keeps me healthy both physically and mentally.  It also allows me to not feel as if I am restricting myself and then having that gorge of junk foods.
</p>
<p>
Simultaneously I have seen people on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook talk about how they are eating anything and everything they can and I don't fully understand that.  Your diet should be important regardless of how hard you are training.  If you are planning on staying in the sport of triathlon why would you let yourself go to the point that you are starting behind where you were previously?  Why you wouldn't want to maintain proper nutrition is beyond me.  Have I gained a few pounds since that last race? Yes, but I have maintained a healthy weight that is only 3-4 pounds over my racing weight.  I am not restricting myself and not counting calories but I am also being rather cognizant of my consumption.
</p>
<p>
  By paying attention to what I am eating I have been able to jump on long rides with friends and chase them around North Texas without feeling as if I have thrown away the advances I made at the beginning of the year.  As a matter of fact after the 4 hour ride I did this past weekend I went out and ran for over one hour the next day and maintained a pace that was faster then where I left off on my Zone 2 runs from April.  I contribute this ability to paying attention to my nutrition even though I am in my off-season.  Oh, and by the way in the middle of the ride we stopped and I consumed two donuts!  See, you don't have to restrict yourself but you should pay attention.
